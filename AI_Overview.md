Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals: AI Overview


What is AI?
Simply put, AI is software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

Machine learning - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
Computer vision - Capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
Natural language processing - Capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
Document intelligence - Capabilities within AI that deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.
Knowledge mining - Capabilities within AI to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
Generative AI - Capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.

Azure Machine Learning Studio offers multiple authoring experiences such as:

Automated machine learning: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

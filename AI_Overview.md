# Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals: AI Overview


**What is AI?**
Simply put, AI is software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

1. Machine learning - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
2. Computer vision - Capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
3. Natural language processing - Capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
4. Document intelligence - Capabilities within AI that deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.
5. Knowledge mining - Capabilities within AI to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
6. Generative AI - Capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.

**Azure Machine Learning Studio offers multiple authoring experiences such as:**
1. Automated machine learning: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
2. Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
3. Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
4. Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

**Understand computer vision**
1. Image classification - Image classification involves training a machine learning model to **classify images based on their contents**.
2. Object detection - Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and **identify their location with a bounding box**.
3. Semantic segmentation - Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which **individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong**.
4. Image analysis - You can create solutions that combine machine learning models with advanced image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even **descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image**.
5. Face detection, analysis, and recognition - Face detection is a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image. This can be combined with classification and facial geometry analysis techniques to recognize individuals based on their **facial features**.
6. Optical character recognition (OCR) - Optical character recognition is a technique used to **detect and read text in image**

You can use Microsoft's Azure AI Vision to develop computer vision solutions.
Some features of Azure AI Vision include:
1. Image Analysis: capabilities for analyzing images and video, and extracting descriptions, tags, objects, and text.
2. Face: capabilities that enable you to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.
3. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): capabilities for extracting printed or handwritten text from images, enabling access to a digital version of the scanned text.

**Understand natural language processing**
NLP enables you to create software that can:

1. Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
2. Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
3. Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
4. Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.

You can use Microsoft's **Azure AI Language** to build natural language processing solutions. Some features of Azure AI Language include understanding and analyzing text, training conversational language models that can understand spoken or text-based commands, and building intelligent applications.
Microsoft's **Azure AI Speech** is another service that can be used to build natural language processing solutions. Azure AI Speech features include speech recognition and synthesis, real-time translations, conversation transcriptions, and more.
Microsoft's **Azure AI Translator** uses a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model for translation**, which analyzes the semantic context of the text and renders a more accurate and complete translation as a result.
You can explore Azure AI Language features in the Azure Language Studio and Azure AI Speech features in the Azure Speech Studio. The service features are available for use and testing in the studios and other programming languages.

**Document intelligence in Microsoft Azure**
You can use Microsoft's **Azure AI Document Intelligence** to build solutions that manage and accelerate data collection from scanned documents. Features of Azure AI Document Intelligence help automate document processing in applications and workflows, enhance data-driven strategies, and enrich document search capabilities. The service features are available for use and testing in the **Document Intelligence Studio and other programming languages**.
**Knowledge mining** is the term used to describe solutions that involve extracting information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store. One Microsoft knowledge mining solution is **Azure AI Search**, a private, enterprise, search solution that has tools for building indexes.

**Generative AI in Microsoft Azure**
**Azure OpenAI Service** is Microsoft's cloud solution for deploying, customizing, and hosting generative AI models. The service features are available for use and testing with Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft's platform for designing enterprise-grade AI solutions. You can use the **Azure AI Foundry** portal to manage, develop, and customize generative AI models.

**Understand Responsible AI**
1. Fairness
2. Reliability and safety
3. Privacy and security
4. Inclusiveness
5. Transparency
6. Accountability

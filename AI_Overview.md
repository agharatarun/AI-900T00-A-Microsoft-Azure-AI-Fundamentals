# Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals: AI Overview


**What is AI?**
Simply put, AI is software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

1. Machine learning - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
2. Computer vision - Capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
3. Natural language processing - Capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
4. Document intelligence - Capabilities within AI that deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.
5. Knowledge mining - Capabilities within AI to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
6. Generative AI - Capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.

**Azure Machine Learning Studio offers multiple authoring experiences such as:**
1. Automated machine learning: this feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
2. Azure Machine Learning designer: a graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
3. Data metric visualization: analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
4. Notebooks: write and run your own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.

**Understand computer vision**
1. Image classification - Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents.
2. Object detection - Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box.
3. Semantic segmentation - Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong.
4. Image analysis - You can create solutions that combine machine learning models with advanced image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image.
5. Face detection, analysis, and recognition - Face detection is a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image. This can be combined with classification and facial geometry analysis techniques to recognize individuals based on their facial features.
6. Optical character recognition (OCR) - Optical character recognition is a technique used to detect and read text in image

You can use Microsoft's Azure AI Vision to develop computer vision solutions.
Some features of Azure AI Vision include:
1. Image Analysis: capabilities for analyzing images and video, and extracting descriptions, tags, objects, and text.
2. Face: capabilities that enable you to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.
3. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): capabilities for extracting printed or handwritten text from images, enabling access to a digital version of the scanned text.
